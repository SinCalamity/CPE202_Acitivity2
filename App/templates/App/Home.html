                <h4>My Experience in my Course so far</h4>
                <hr>
                <p>In my Experience with my course of BS Computer Engineering, every thought I think
                    about it was hard as there will be involvement of mathematics and electronics.
                    During my first year in the first semester, there was really nothing much to expecting
                    with other subjects excepted for two subjects which is Chemistry and Calculus.
                    Miraculously, I was able to pass this subjects and move on.</p>

                <p>Moving to second semester of first year, three subjects were very challenging Calculus2,
                    Physics, and lastly Prologdes. Sadly, I failed my calculus2 and had to go through summer
                    classes, physics was easy and Prologdes I barely passed.
                    This semester was the first time I had a lot of challenges due to my schedule being at
                    night and my bipolar thought process going through me.</p>

                <p>Now Iâ€™m currently in my Second year in first semester.</p>

                    The skills will provide beneficial aid/help from future jobs:</p>
                <h6>Critical Thinking: </h6><p>Obtained from solving mathematical equations
                from the subjects: Calculus, Physics, and other problem-solving subjects.</p>
                <h6>Analytical Thinking: </h6><p>Obtained from mathematical subjects and from
                laboratory subjects.</p>
                <h6>Language acquisition: </h6><p>Obtained from coding subjects with learning the first
                programming language(C++) that was taught to me.</p>
                <h6>Data Analysis: </h6><p>Obtained from analyzing work and improving the said work.</p>

                <h4>Job opportunities I would consider taking</h4>
                <hr>
                <h6>----Information Security Analyst----</h6>
                <h6>----Computer Systems Engineer----</h6>
                <h6>----Network Administrator----</h6>
                <p>These are jobs I can consider taking as they are high-paying jobs.
                    Although there may be other opportunities for me to look for. These are the ones I want to
                    focus for now. With the course I am taking, I should develop other attainable skills other
                    than the once I have attained.</p>
                <hr>
                <h4>In case of Backup</h4>
                <p>I would consider shifting courses if difficulty arises. It could be rough for me to do so
                    but every opportunity can be a lasting hope to land a job.</p>
                <p>I would consider taking Architecture for backup.</p>
